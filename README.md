# Databases and graph libraries for machine learning of material science
- These are databases and demo codes for the following paper
- "Integrating multiple materials science projects in a single neural network"
- Published in ["Communications Materials"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-020-00052-8)

# Install
- conda env create -f=requirements.yaml

# Usage
- You can view databases used in the study in a "database" folder
- You can run jupyter notebook codes for the demo codes in a "codes" folder
(prediction of conductivity of PEDOT-PSS from texts, multitask learning of multiple databases, inverse problems, and control experiments against the graph approach)
